This is the online version of the workshop.


It is not easy to control the snake with 2 axes of the accelerometer inside of [create.withcode.uk](https://create.withcode.uk/), which is emulated with sliders.

Instead the snake is controlled with A and B buttons on the micro:bit, for turning clockwise and anti-clockwise.
